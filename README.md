7dRTS
=====

A small 2D game (mildly inspired by Neptune's Pride) made for the 7dRTS Ludum Dare mini competition.
Uses Slick2D (lwjgl + jogg 0.0.7 + jorbis 0.0.15) and the TerrorLibrary (not available to the public (yet!)).

A lot of it needs cleaning up, due to it being rushed. Things like spatial partitioning for Stars 
and fleets would speed things things up quite a lot (not that it's slow, just not as fast as 
it should be), and the pathfinding could benefit from A*.
