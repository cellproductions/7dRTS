7dRTS
=====

A mild Neptunes Pride clone made for the 7dRTS Ludum Dare mini competition.
Uses Slick2D (lwjgl + jogg 0.0.7 + jorbis 0.0.15) and the TerrorLibrary.

A lot of it needs cleaning up, as it was rushed. Things like spatial partitioning for Stars 
and fleets would speed things things up quite a lot (not that it's slow, just not as fast as 
it should be).
