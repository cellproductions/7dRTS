TODO:
* add waypoint control
	* add a waypoint control button that goes through all fleets and starts them on their paths if their paths arent empty
* zoom in on cursor position in world space
* add dragging around the screen []
* end game tech allows jumping across stars without lines
* fleets should wait for a bit while conquering a populated star
* add timer to fleet display (show how long fleet will take to get to destination)
* allow splitting fleets into new fleets
* not sure that fleet hud is entirely useful (maybe add speed label + split button)
* stop tech from increasing so rapidly []
* ai should know when its out of (low on) ships []
* add random generated black holes that consume whole fleets
* pressing tab should also show the % of stars that the player controls
* ai should be able to build up fleets []
* scroll by moving the mouse to the screen edges
* add selection box (select and move multiple fleets)
* add shaders? (some kind of light reflections or whatever, bloom from stars)
* may require a lot of refactoring, but create a spatial partitioner (Map filled with Stars with their Positions as Keys), finding the nearest star is much faster now
* show game timer
* potentially, you can gain tech points so quickly that the beep sound will become loud and constant, fix

BUGS:
* if path has exhausted all possibilities, game crashes (fix so that if queue is empty after complete search, set dest back to the beginning)
* name generator takes way too long, fix
* drawing movement paths can draw straight from star to star without connections
* after clicking on a star that wasnt preowned by the player, the build fleet button doesnt work on it, and the minimap controls stop working []
* crash when queueing stars with waypoints (if worst comes to worst, remove waypoints)
* fleet resolution still does not work for some reason (not sure if fixed) []
* pathfinding is incorrect (doesnt go to nearest in mid flight)
* total tech increases to amounts beyond the actual number
* cant deselect enemy units
* can still colonize star even though it has max pop []
* not all the stars connect
* some void stars still remain (stars that consume whole fleets)
* some fleets (upon placing) still do not stack up
* camera no longer moves to the starting position
* pressing H once you've lost your home star will crash (hasnt changed yet)

[] means i think its fixed
average FPS is 600
